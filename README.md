# Wildcats2023S2

The Perth Wildcats are a leading team in the National Basketball League (NBL) and are always seeking new ways to improve their performance. One critical area where technology can help is player recruitment. This proposal outlines how AI and statistics, along with visualization tools, can be used to improve the team's player recruiting process.

The data for this project will need to undergo cleaning and pre-processing to remove any missing or irrelevant information and to prepare the data for analysis. AI and statistical methods will be applied to the data to identify patterns and trends that could impact player performance. This may include regression analysis, clustering, and decision tree analysis. The results of the data analysis will be presented using visualization tools to help the General Manager and coaching staff make informed decisions about potential recruits. The analysis will be used to guide the player recruiting process both domestically and abroad, helping the coaching staff to identify the most promising players based on their performance and potential. By using AI and statistics, along with visualization tools, the Perth Wildcats will be able to make more informed and data-driven decisions about player recruitment. This will help to improve the team's overall performance and increase the likelihood of success on the court.
